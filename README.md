Hello,

I have divided the code challenges into three parts:

1-The React project showcases all the other challenges and technical questions.
2-The Express project is a simple API endpoint that returns a static message.
3-The Next.js project is a static page that fetches data from a JSON file.

Thereâ€™s also a PDF with the technical questions answered.

I deployed these three projects to Vercel:
