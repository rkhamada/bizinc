// 2. Conceptual Question:
// ‚óè What are the differences between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
//     In JavaScript, both == and === are used to compare values, but they differ in how they handle the comparison:
//     The first is loose equality, which means that JavaScript will try to convert the variables to a common type before comparing.
//     The second is strict equality, which means that JavaScript will compare both the value and the type, and will return false if either the value or type is different.
//     For instance, "1" === 1 would return false, but "1" == 1 would return true.
